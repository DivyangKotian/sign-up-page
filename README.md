**Sign-up Form with Password Validation**
=====================================

**Description**
------------

This is a simple sign-up form that validates user input and displays error messages accordingly. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password. The password validation checks for the following requirements:

* At least one lowercase letter
* At least one uppercase letter
* At least one number
* Minimum length of 8 characters

The project is for educational purposes and has helped me explore a lot of intermediate concepts and techniques.

**Features**
---------

* Password validation with real-time feedback
* Error messages for invalid input
* Form submission disabled until all fields are valid
* Customizable CSS styles for form elements and error messages
* Floating labels, which are placeholders until the input is in focus
* Real time validation of each input with borders for visual ease on user.

**Limitations**
--------

* This project has been tested on a limited set of browsers and devices, and its behavior may vary on other platforms.
* The password validation rules may not cover all possible scenarios, and users may still find ways to bypass the validation.
* This project does not store passwords securely and should not be used in production without proper security measures in place.
* This project is a minimal implementation and lacks many features compared to similar projects.
* The project relies on outdated libraries and dependencies, which may not be compatible with newer versions of other software.
* This project does not support accessibility or internationalization features.
* Error handling is limited, and unexpected errors may occur.
* This project is not suitable for production use due to performance issues and security vulnerabilities.
* Customization options are limited, and the project is designed to be used "as-is".
* There is no guarantee that this project will work with other software or systems.
