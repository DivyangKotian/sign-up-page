**Sign-up Form with Password Validation**
=====================================

**Description**
------------

This is a responsive sign-up form designed to validate user input with real-time feedback. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password. It features:

* At least one lowercase letter
* At least one uppercase letter
* At least one number
* Minimum length of 8 characters

The form dynamically adjusts its layout based on screen size, with the image positioning itself correctly in relation to the footer on larger screens and above the form on smaller screens.

The project is for educational purposes and has helped me explore a lot of intermediate concepts and techniques.

**Features**
---------

* Password validation with real-time feedback
* Error messages for invalid input
* Form submission disabled until all fields are valid
* Customizable CSS styles for form elements and error messages
* Floating labels that act as placeholders until the input is focused
* Real time validation of each input with borders for visual ease on user.
* Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes.
* Dynamic image placement: image stays right above the footer on large screens and above the form on smaller screens


**Limitations**
--------

* This project has been tested on a limited set of browsers and devices, and its behavior may vary on other platforms.
* The password validation rules may not cover all possible scenarios, and users may still find ways to bypass the validation.
* This project does not store passwords securely and should not be used in production without proper security measures in place.
* This project is a minimal implementation and lacks many features compared to similar projects.
* Relies on outdated libraries and dependencies, which may not be compatible with newer versions of other software.
* Error handling is limited, and unexpected errors may occur.
* Customization options are limited, and the project is designed to be used "as-is".
* There is no guarantee that this project will work with other software or systems.
